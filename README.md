how 2 use?????

so ur gonna wanna tell your victim to bookmark the code in removal.js

if they don't already have their bookmarks bar open, tell them to click CTRL+SHIFT+B, right click an empty field and click "add page". once they do that there will be a section called "URL" they will enter the code in removal.js there. 

wow, you now removed the warning banner.
